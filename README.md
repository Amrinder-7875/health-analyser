Overview

The AI Health Report Analyzer is an intelligent web-based tool designed to make medical reports easier to understand. Users can upload a PDF health report, and the system extracts the content, analyzes it using an AI model, and generates a structured summary with key highlights, abnormal values, and health suggestions.

This project was built as a minor academic project to explore how AI can be integrated into real-world web applications.
